      <description>In second year of university I completed a project involving the development of an android app.
I decided to utilize firebase as it provided a robust login system for handling users. The app allowed users to save dreams they have, with the ability to set up an alarm notification that would take them to the new dream screen. This screen allowed the user to use speech to text android functionality to enter in their dreams as most users would be too sleepy to type when they had just woken up.</description>

      <description>For my A level computing project I took on a project converting an existing paper mileage tracking system that was currently in use by my Father at the time into a digital format. This allowed the entering of mileage informaiton from either a smart phone or a pc, making the process easier. This was later digitized by the RSPCA in a similar way through the use of google forms.
To achieve this I created a HTML, CSS, JavaScript using firebase as a backend.</description>
