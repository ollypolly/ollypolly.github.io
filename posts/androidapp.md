In second year of university I completed a project involving the development of an android app.

I decided to utilize firebase as it provided a robust login system for handling users. The app allowed users to save dreams they have, with the ability to set up an alarm notification that would take them to the new dream screen. This screen allowed the user to use speech to text android functionality to enter in their dreams as most users would be too sleepy to type when they had just woken up.

Users could then decide to post their dreams to be publicly available board called the dreamscape. Alternively they could post there nightmares to a public board known as the nightscape.

This project allowed be to develop my Java skills and android knowledge of activities.
