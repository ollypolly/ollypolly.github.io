For my Final Year Project at university I developed a web application using React, Redux and Firebase.

This system collected data about network rail services using Firebase cloud functions overnight to allow users to make decisions on their train journeys. The website also used certain third party APIs to display informtion about current departure boards, and trains of up to a week prior.
