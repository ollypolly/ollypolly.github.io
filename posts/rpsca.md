For my A level computing project I took on a project converting an existing paper mileage tracking system that was currently in use by my Father at the time into a digital format. This allowed the entering of mileage informaiton from either a smart phone or a pc, making the process easier. This was later digitized by the RSPCA in a similar way through the use of google forms.

To achieve this I created a HTML, CSS, JavaScript using firebase as a backend. The application would produce a paper pdf claim form to then be submitted to RSPCA.
