			<description>For my Final Year Project at university I developed a web application using React, Redux and Firebase.
This system collected data about network rail services using Firebase cloud functions overnight to allow users to make decisions on their train journeys. The website also used certain third party APIs to display informtion about current departure boards, and trains of up to a week prior.

			<description>I took on the redesign of a current church website. The website used a content management system ExpressionEngine. I redesigned the front end of the website and used the existing backend to add more features to the website. I also ensured the website was fully mobile responsive.

			<description>In second year of university I completed a project involving the development of an android app.
I decided to utilize firebase as it provided a robust login system for handling users. The app allowed users to save dreams they have, with the ability to set up an alarm notification that would take them to the new dream screen. This screen allowed the user to use speech to text android functionality to enter in their dreams as most users would be too sleepy to type when they had just woken up.</description>

This screen allowed the user to use speech to text android functionality to enter in their dreams as most users would be too sleepy to type when they had just woken up.</p>

<p>Users could then decide to post their dreams to be publicly available board called the dreamscape. Alternively they could post there nightmares to a public board known as the nightscape.</p>

<p>This project allowed be to develop my Java skills and android knowledge of activities.</p>

			<title>A level Computing Project - Web RSPCA Mileage Tracker</title>

			<description>For my A level computing project I took on a project converting an existing paper mileage tracking system that was currently in use by my Father at the time into a digital format. This allowed the entering of mileage informaiton from either a smart phone or a pc, making the process easier. This was later digitized by the RSPCA in a similar way through the use of google forms.
To achieve this I created a HTML, CSS, JavaScript using firebase as a backend.</description>

			<description>For the final project of AS level computing it was required that we develop a game in Visual Basic.
The game I chose to develop was mancala, a two player came in which stones are moved around a row of holes in order to capture the opponents. pieces. This game utilized the build in design editor of Visual Basic package we were given.</description>
