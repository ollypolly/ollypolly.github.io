I am currently developing an update to the website I redesigned in 2018. This system will provide a method of accepting payment and providing tickets for events held at the venue.  The website will also feature an admin view to manage and create events and tickets.

This system is being built using React, Express, MongoDB, Node, GraphQL and Stripe.
